Game Rules:
- You will make guesses, and the game will provide feedback in the form of one of the following clues:
  - "Bagels": No digits in your guess are correct.
  - "Pico": One digit in your guess is correct but in the wrong position.
  - "Fermi": One digit in your guess is correct and in the correct position.
- The goal is to guess the secret number by using these clues and logic to eliminate incorrect guesses.

Good luck, and may your deductive reasoning lead you to victory!"""
